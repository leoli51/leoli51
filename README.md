### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently doing a Master in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence at Polimi.<br>

I'm very curious and love when informatics meets the audiovisual realm. Especially when creative minds use code to produce an artistic outcome or to visualize data or reality in a new way. If you like it as well you should have a look at these:

I created some games in the past (they are not on github) but if you are interested:
  * [An unfinished stealth game](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/717126)
  * [My entry for the Miz1 Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/miz-jam-1/rate/732511)
 
Happy coding!
