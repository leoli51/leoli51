### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am currently finishing my bachelor in Computer Science at Sapienza University of Rome.<br>
Right now I'm learning about NLP for my thesis work.<br>

I'm very curious and love when informatics meets the audiovisual realm. Especially when creative minds use code to produce an artistic outcome or to visualize data or reality in a new way. If you like it as well you should have a look at these:

  * [Carykh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA3YOFUCn4U)
 
I created some games in the past (they are not on github) but if you are interested:
  * [An unfinished stealth game](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/717126)
  * [My entry for the Miz1 Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/miz-jam-1/rate/732511)
 
Happy coding!
